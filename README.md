Text Preprocessing and Featurization Report
Introduction
Text preprocessing is a crucial step in natural language processing (NLP) tasks, where the raw text data undergoes several transformations to make it suitable for analysis and modeling. In this report, we'll discuss the preprocessing steps and the featurization method adopted for a given dataset of BBC articles.

1. Dataset Overview
The dataset consists of BBC articles stored in a CSV file named 'bbc_articles.csv'. Each article contains text data that needs to be preprocessed and transformed into numerical features for machine learning tasks.

2. Preprocessing Steps
The following preprocessing steps were performed on the text data:

    2.1 Tokenization
          Tokenization is the process of breaking down text into individual words, phrases, symbols, or other meaningful elements called tokens. The word_tokenize function from the NLTK library was used to       
          tokenize the text data.

    2.2 Stopword Removal
          Stopwords are common words in a language that do not contribute much to the content or meaning of a document, such as "the," "and," and "is." Stopword removal helps in reducing noise and improving the             efficiency of text analysis. NLTK's stopwords corpus was used to remove stopwords from the tokenized text.

   2.3 Lowercasing and Filtering
          All words were converted to lowercase to ensure uniformity and to prevent duplication of words based on case. Additionally, non-alphabetic characters were filtered out to retain only meaningful words.

3. Featurization Method
The featurization method adopted for this task is TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency). TF-IDF is a numerical statistic that reflects how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus. It combines the term frequency (TF) and inverse document frequency (IDF) to generate feature vectors representing each document.

    3.1 TF-IDF Vectorization
          The TfidfVectorizer from the scikit-learn library was used to convert the preprocessed text data into TF-IDF feature vectors. TF-IDF vectorization assigns weights to words based on their frequency in a            document and their rarity across the entire corpus.

4. Conclusion
Text preprocessing is an essential step in NLP tasks, as it transforms raw text data into a format suitable for analysis and modeling. In this report, we discussed the preprocessing steps, including tokenization, stopword removal, lowercasing, and filtering. We also explored the featurization method of TF-IDF vectorization, which converts text data into numerical feature vectors. These processed and vectorized features are crucial for training machine learning models and extracting insights from text data.

By following these preprocessing and featurization techniques, we can effectively analyze and extract valuable information from text data, enabling various NLP applications such as sentiment analysis, text classification, and information retrieval.
